h1. Redmine Datacenter Plugin

**THIS PLUGIN IS NOT MAINTAINED ACTIVELY ANYMORE, AND YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT.** (I only make patches for my former colleagues who still use it for some months)

This plugin will help you manager your small datacenter through "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org/.

h2. Install

See first: "http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins":http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins 

There are only 3 installation steps, it's very easy :
* clone this repository in your vendor/plugins directory ; if you have a doubt you put it at the good level, you can check you have a vendor/plugins/redmine_datacenter/init.rb file
* run the migrations with : rake db:migrate_plugins
* restart your Redmine instance (depends on how you host it)

h2. Contribute

If you like this plugin, it's a good idea to contribute :
* by giving feed back on what is cool, what should be improved
* by reporting bugs : you can open issues directly on github for the moment
* by forking it and sending pull request if you have a patch or a feature you want to implement

h2. Known bugs / limitations

Here are some limitations I see in the actual implementation ; maybe they will be solved in future releases (depending on my own needs and potential requests from .. you) :
* bad separation of datacenters at project level : you can enable/disable "datacenter" module at project level ; but if you enable it on two different projects, 1/ you will see the same servers/apps/etc., 2/ you'll see issues from other projects. The main problem is I don't know how to handle separation, functionnaly first, and also technically... Any idea would be welcome !

h2. Icons

The icons, as some of redmine's core, are taken from the Silk icons set. You can find it at "http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/":http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/
